1. Netflix (Streaming Platform)
Use Case:
  Handling millions of concurrent streams with autoscaling
  Running microservices (video encoding, recommendation engine, API gateways)
How Kubernetes Helps:
  Auto-scales pods during peak traffic (e.g., weekends, new show releases)
  Manages deployments for thousands of microservices
  Ensures high availability using node affinity and self-healing

2. Airbnb (Travel & Booking Platform)
Use Case:
  Serves real-time recommendations, booking flows, messaging

How Kubernetes Helps:
  Deploys and rolls back new services quickly with canary deployments
  Uses Helm to manage complex applications (Redis, Kafka, etc.)
  Improves developer velocity with ArgoCD-based GitOps

3. Spotify (Music Streaming)
  Use Case:
    Processes real-time audio, user activity, playlist generation

How Kubernetes Helps:
  Real-time metrics scraping (Prometheus) and custom autoscalers
  Scales backend services based on listener traffic by region
  Deploys machine learning models as microservices in Kubernetes

4. Banking/FinTech (e.g., Capital One)
Use Case:
  Secure microservices for transactions, fraud detection, APIs

How Kubernetes Helps:
  Leverages RBAC and PodSecurityPolicies for fine-grained control
  Uses service meshes like Istio for traffic splitting and mutual TLS
  Automated compliance and patching using CI/CD pipelines in K8s

5. E-Commerce (e.g., Shopify)
Use Case:
  Handles flash sales, order processing, inventory updates in real-time

How Kubernetes Helps:
  Uses HPA and Cluster Autoscaler to scale with traffic spikes
  Isolates customer workloads using namespaces & quotas
  Enables blue/green deployments to minimize downtime

 How It Works (Architecture Overview):
             +---------------------+
         |   Users / Clients   |
         +----------+----------+
                    |
               [Ingress Controller]
                    |
     +--------------+--------------+
     |                             |
[Service A]                    [Service B]
[Pod x3]                       [Pod x2]
 (e.g., Web App)              (e.g., API)
     |                             |
[Database]                    [Redis, Kafka]
     |
[Cloud Storage / RDS]

üõ† Kubernetes Components in Action:
  Ingress: Routes external requests to the right service
  Services: Expose internal workloads with ClusterIP or LoadBalancer
  Deployments: Manages rolling updates and rollbacks
  HPA: Scales pods based on CPU or custom metrics
  ConfigMaps/Secrets: Injects app configuration and secure tokens
  Helm/ArgoCD: Automates deployment and GitOps
