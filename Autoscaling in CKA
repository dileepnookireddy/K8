In the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam, autoscaling is an important concept under Cluster Maintenance and Workloads & Scheduling. 
You’re expected to understand how to configure Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) and Cluster Autoscalers, and possibly troubleshoot them.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)

🔄 1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
HPA automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment, replicaset, or statefulset based on observed CPU/memory usage or custom metrics.

✅ Key Features:
  Scales pods, not nodes.
  Uses metrics-server for metrics (CPU, memory).
  Common for stateless apps like web servers, APIs.

🛠️ Prerequisites:
kubectl top pods        # Should return CPU/Memory info (metrics-server must be installed)

🔧 Create HPA (Example):
kubectl autoscale deployment myapp --cpu-percent=50 --min=2 --max=5

Or use a YAML definition:
------------------------
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: myapp-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myapp
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50

 Check Status:
------------
kubectl get hpa
kubectl describe hpa myapp-hpa

🧱 2. Cluster Autoscaler
This adds or removes worker nodes based on the pending pods that cannot be scheduled due to resource constraints.

✅ Key Features:
  Scales nodes, not pods.
  Usually configured by cloud providers like GKE, EKS, AKS, etc.
  Not likely to be tested in full detail in bare-metal exam environments unless specified.

⚠️ NOTE:
In the CKA exam, HPA is more common and testable than Cluster Autoscaler unless the environment explicitly supports node autoscaling.

⚙️ Quick Tips for CKA Exam
   Always check if metrics-server is installed (kubectl top pods must work).
   Know how to create, view, and modify HPA objects.
You might be asked to:
  Deploy an HPA with certain thresholds.
  Identify why HPA isn’t scaling (e.g., metrics-server not running).
  Simulate load using a tool like stress or a CPU-intensive loop to test autoscaling.

🧪 Simulate Load (for testing HPA):
kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --rm --image=busybox -- /bin/sh

# Inside pod
while true; do wget -q -O- http://myapp-service; done

Autoscaling adjusts resources up during high traffic and down when it normalizes.

2.Vertical Pod Atoscaler
3.Cluster Proportional Autoscaler
4.K8s Event driven Autoscaling (KEDA) scaling
-----------------------------------------------------------
Why do we need autoscaling -->  for COST SAVINGS
1. Improved Application availbility 
2.Efficient resource utilisation 
3.Elasticity 
4.Fault tolerance and recovery
5. Seemless load management 
6. Simplified Management 
----------------------------------
Cluster Scaling --> (Scaling nodes, Clusgter Availability , Cluster Capacity) --> Ensures the infrastructure is up to the task 
Pod Scaling --> (Scaling pod/replicas , Application Availability, Application Efficiency) --> Guarantess the application is up to the task

Both ensures the k8s cluster and applciations have the required capacity.

Components of Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA):
------------------------------------------------
The Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) project consists of 3 key components that work together to monitor, recommend, and adjust resource requests for Kubernetes pods. These components include the following:

1. Recommender
Role: The Recommender continuously monitors the current and past resource consumption (CPU and memory) of containers.
Functionality:
Based on the observed usage, it provides recommended values for the containers' CPU and memory requests.
These recommendations are used by the other components to adjust the resource allocations for containers.
Purpose: Ensures that the resource requests of containers are always optimally set based on their actual usage, helping avoid both over-provisioning and under-provisioning of resources.
2. Updater
Role: The Updater is responsible for ensuring that running pods have the correct resource requests as per the Recommender's suggestions.
Functionality:
It checks which of the managed pods have outdated or incorrect resource settings.
If a pod's resources need to be updated, the Updater will evict (terminate) the pod so that it can be recreated by its controller (e.g., Deployment, ReplicaSet) with the updated resource requests.
Purpose: This ensures that the running pods always have the recommended resources by restarting pods with the updated requests if necessary.
3. Admission Plugin
Role: The Admission Plugin sets the correct resource requests on new pods, either when they are first created or when they are recreated due to the Updater's action.
Functionality:
It works during the pod creation process, checking if the pod is managed by VPA.
If the pod is managed by VPA, it modifies the pod's resource requests to reflect the recommended values provided by the Recommender.
Purpose: Ensures that newly created or recreated pods start with the optimal resource requests from the very beginning.
These three components (Recommender, Updater, and Admission Plugin) work together to provide dynamic resource allocation for Kubernetes pods, optimizing resource usage and improving cluster efficiency.

Introduction to Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
----------------------------
You have recently deployed a Flask application to your Kubernetes cluster. However, the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) vpa-updater-XXXX pod indicates that there may be an issue with the newly deployed flask-app pods.

Inspect the logs of the vpa-updater-XXXX pod and observe the following message:
Check the logs of the vpa-updater-XXXX pod to identify any potential issues with the flask-app deployment.

When checking the logs, you see the following error message:
pods_eviction_restriction.go:226] **too few replicas** for **ReplicaSet** default/**flask-app-b6c9c4f78**

Problem Analysis:

Flask application is running with only 1 replica pod.
The Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) needs to evict (remove) the existing pod to create a new one with updated resource settings.
Kubernetes has a safety feature that prevents removing the last pod of a deployment to avoid service downtime.
When you have only 1 replica and VPA tries to evict it, Kubernetes blocks this action with the error message: "too few replicas".
VPA wants to optimize your pod's resources but cannot because Kubernetes is protecting your service availability.
As a result, VPA cannot apply its resource recommendations, and application cannot benefit from automatic resource optimization.

Approach to Resolve the Issue:
1. Increase the replica count:
kubectl scale deployment flask-app --replicas=2

2. Verify the Deployment:
kubectl get deployment flask-app -o wide

Ensure that the DESIRED column shows the updated replica count, and the CURRENT column matches the desired number.

3. Check the Pod Status:
kubectl get pods -l app=flask-app

Wait until all pods show Running status.
You should see two pods (or more) in a Running state.

4. Verify VPA operation:
kubectl describe vpa flask-app

This will show the current state of the VPA and any recommendations it has made. If it's working properly, you should see resource recommendations (for CPU and memory) in the output.

With 2 replicas, Kubernetes can safely remove one pod while keeping your application running, allowing VPA to work properly.
