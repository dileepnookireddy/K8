KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) is an advanced and flexible autoscaling solution for Kubernetes that goes beyond the capabilities of the standard Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). 
It's particularly useful for event-driven workloads, such as message queues, cron jobs, or cloud events.

🚀 What is KEDA?
KEDA is a Kubernetes-based autoscaler that can scale pods based on external metrics or events (e.g., message queue depth, CPU usage, Prometheus queries, custom metrics).

🔹 Key Features:
----------------
| Feature                     | Description                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 Scales **to and from 0** | Unlike HPA, KEDA can **scale down to 0 pods**, saving resources during idle time.   |
| 📥 Event-driven             | Reacts to **event sources** like RabbitMQ, Kafka, Azure Service Bus, SQS, etc.      |
| 🔌 80+ scalers              | Supports many **built-in scalers** (Redis, MongoDB, Prometheus, etc.).              |
| ⚙️ Works with HPA           | KEDA acts as an HPA **metrics provider** and manages scaling transparently.         |
| 🔐 Secure                   | Uses **Kubernetes Secrets** to access secure credentials (e.g., cloud access keys). |


🛠️ How It Works
KEDA introduces two main components:
1.ScaledObject – Defines how to scale a deployment based on an event source.
2.Scaler – A plugin that connects to the external system and provides metric data.

📦 Example: Scale a Deployment Based on Queue Length (e.g., RabbitMQ):
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: queue-scaler
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: worker
  minReplicaCount: 0
  maxReplicaCount: 10
  triggers:
  - type: rabbitmq
    metadata:
      queueName: my-queue
      hostFromEnv: RABBITMQ_HOST
      queueLength: "100"

This will scale the worker deployment from 0 to 10 pods based on whether the RabbitMQ queue my-queue has more than 100 messages.

✨ KEDA vs HPA:
----------------
| Feature                   | HPA                                          | KEDA                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Metrics Source            | CPU, memory, custom metrics (via Prometheus) | 80+ sources (Kafka, Redis, AWS SQS, Cron, etc.) |
| Scale to Zero             | ❌ No                                         | ✅ Yes                                           |
| Event-driven              | ❌ No                                         | ✅ Yes                                           |
| Easy external integration | ❌ Limited                                    | ✅ Rich                                          |

🧪 Common Use Cases:
--------------------
Auto-scaling background jobs based on message queue length
Scaling data processors for Kafka, SQS, Azure EventHub
Scheduled jobs or cron-based autoscaling
Dynamic scaling for Prometheus alerts, database queues, webhooks

🧰 Commands
Install KEDA using Helm:
----------------------
helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm install keda kedacore/keda --namespace keda --create-namespace

🔐 Pro Tip for CKA + CNCF Focus:
-------------------------------
--> While KEDA is not part of the core CKA curriculum, it's increasingly relevant for cloud-native and event-driven architectures.
--> Understanding it shows you're aware of advanced autoscaling strategies in production environments.
