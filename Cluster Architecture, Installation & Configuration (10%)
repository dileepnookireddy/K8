CKA: Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration – Cheat Sheet & Practice Workbook
---------------------------
Install Kubernetes using kubeadm
•	Use kubeadm to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.
•	Install Docker/CRI-O/Containerd and kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl.
•	Initialize master: kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=<CIDR>
•	Join worker: kubeadm join <master-ip>:<port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>

Configure Certificates
•	Certificates stored in /etc/kubernetes/pki/
•	kubeadm auto-generates certs using cfssl under the hood.
•	Use kubeadm alpha certs renew to renew expired certs.
•	Backup certs before any operation involving cert changes.

Manage kubeconfig
•	kubeconfig file typically at ~/.kube/config
•	Generated automatically on master with kubeadm init.
•	Use kubectl config get-contexts / use-context to manage multiple clusters.
•	Can export admin.conf from master to access cluster from another system.

Systemd Services for Control Plane & Worker Nodes
•	Control plane components: kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler – managed via static pods.
•	Worker services: kubelet, container runtime, kube-proxy.
•	Use systemctl to check status: systemctl status kubelet
•	Static pod manifests: /etc/kubernetes/manifests/

Upgrade a Kubernetes Cluster
•	Upgrade control plane node using: kubeadm upgrade plan && kubeadm upgrade apply <version>
•	Upgrade kubelet/kubectl via apt/yum and restart services.
•	Upgrade worker nodes in rolling fashion.
•	Ensure etcd and backups are safe before upgrade.

Backup and Restore etcd
•	Use etcdctl with certs to backup: etcdctl snapshot save backup.db
•	Restore using: etcdctl snapshot restore backup.db
•	etcdctl requires --cert, --key, and --cacert options with endpoint.
•	Backups should be automated via cron or backup solutions.
