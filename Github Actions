GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform built into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows like building, testing, and deploying code directly from your GitHub repository.

✅ Key Concepts:
| Concept      | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow** | Automated process defined in `.github/workflows/*.yml` file |
| **Job**      | A set of steps executed on the same runner                  |
| **Step**     | A command or action that runs as part of a job              |
| **Runner**   | Machine that runs your jobs (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted)  |
| **Action**   | A reusable unit of code (like a function or plugin)         |

📁 Folder Structure Example:
your-repo/
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── ci.yml


🔧 Sample GitHub Actions Workflow (CI example):
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest

🚀 Use Cases
Build & Test code on push or PR
Deploy to servers/clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, K8s)
Lint, Format, Scan your code
Create Releases, publish to PyPI/NPM/Docker Hub

📚 Example Marketplace Actions
You can find reusable actions here: GitHub Marketplace (https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions):
  actions/checkout – check out your code
  docker/build-push-action – build & push Docker images
  actions/upload-artifact – upload test logs/reports
