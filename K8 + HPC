Combining Kubernetes (K8s) with High Performance Computing (HPC) is an emerging and powerful architecture that brings the flexibility and 
automation of Kubernetes to the traditionally static and batch-oriented world of HPC.

 Why Use Kubernetes for HPC?
| Traditional HPC                        | Kubernetes-enhanced HPC                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Static clusters, manual job schedulers | Dynamic resource allocation, containerized workloads |
| Complex job queueing (Slurm, PBS)      | Native or integrated job orchestration               |
| VM/metal-based deployments             | Container-based, lightweight, reproducible           |
| Siloed workloads                       | Multi-tenant, isolated namespaces and RBAC           |

üß† Benefits of Using Kubernetes for HPC Workloads
‚úÖ Containerized Environments
  Isolate dependencies using Docker/Singularity containers.
  No more "dependency hell" between different workloads.

‚úÖ Elastic Scheduling
  Scale compute pods up/down dynamically with Cluster Autoscaler.
  Integrate with cloud bursting (AWS/GCP/Azure) for capacity overflow.

‚úÖ Multi-Tenancy and Fair Usage
  Use namespaces, ResourceQuotas, and LimitRanges for fairness.
  Secure user isolation via RBAC and PodSecurity Standards.

‚úÖ Observability
  Use Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for real-time monitoring and alerting.
  Profile HPC jobs with built-in tracing tools.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges in Kubernetes-HPC Integration:
------------------------------------------
| Challenge                                     | Mitigation                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low-latency networking** (e.g., InfiniBand) | Use SR-IOV & RDMA-enabled plugins                 |
| **Job scheduling complexities**               | Integrate Volcano or Slurm-connector              |
| **File system access** (e.g., Lustre, GPFS)   | Mount HPC FS via CSI drivers                      |
| **MPI process management**                    | Use MPI Operator with init containers & sidecars  |
| **GPU/TPU device exposure**                   | Use device plugins and runtimeClass configuration |
